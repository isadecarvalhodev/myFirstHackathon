# myFirstHackathon
This was my first hackathon with a team of five members.
In my first hackathon, we were given a song to inspire our project. 
The song that my team received was from the movie Coco, 'Remember Me.' 
So, we created a web app that predicts the time you have left to live and where you will go when you die. 
It was just for fun and does not represent real life.
